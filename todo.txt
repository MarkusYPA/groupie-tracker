To do:

x Generate list of countries automatically
x Generate min and max values automatically
- Return correct error states
    . Maybe create a custom page to display them
    . 404
    . 500 especially. Are there 504, 505 etc. errors?
- A bit silly to display the raw API info on the artist page like that
- Could the buttons, dropdowns, number selections or checkboxes be prettier?
    . Javascript?
    . A double slider could be nice for ranges, but a bit exessive and possibly messy code


Bonus:

    general
    - Goroutines? Would they be useful?
    - Deploy the site. Where? How do you set up your own server online?

    basic
    - No unnecessary data requests: It's reading API only once, but is it foolproof?
        .Is that what it means?
    - Testfile? Could be difficult but it is recommended.
